Hey There, Here are the commands stepwise to create a new branch whenever you have to add a new feature to the existing project on which several people are working.

1) Firstly check on which branch you are using:
$ git branch
2) Before creating and switching to new branch pull the latest version of master
$ git pull
3) Now to create a new branch:
$ git branch <name_of_new_branch>
4) Switch to the new branch
$ git checkout <name_of_new_branch>
5) Now Add the files changed:
$ git add .
6) Commit
$ git commit -m "Your message here"
Note: if forgot to use -m and an editor opens press "Esc" key and write :wq then Press Enter
7) Now merge the two branches before that pull the latest version.
$ git pull
$ git merge master
8) Now simple push the new branch created:
$ git push -u <url of project> <name_of_new_branch>
